## 📄 Project Requirements

### 1. Incident Description

- Succinctly summarize a **recent** and **specific** cybersecurity incident

- Describe context, timeline, actors involved, and the impact of the attack

---

### 2. Diamond Model Analysis

Apply the Diamond Model to dissect the incident:

- **Adversary:** Who executed the attack? What was their motive and capability?
- **Victim:** Which individual, organization, or sector was targeted?
- **Infrastructure:** What systems, platforms, or services were exploited?
- **Capability:** What tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) were used?

Include the two **meta-features**:
- **Social-Political Meta-Feature:** How the relationship between adversary and victim is shaped
- **Technological Meta-Feature:** How infrastructure and capabilities are enabled or constrained by technology

- Determine the **best level** for policy intervention:
  - 10 – **Transnational**
  - 9 – **National**
  - 8.5 – **Industry**
  - 8 – **Organizational**
- Provide a clear justification for your chosen level based on:
  - Frequency and risk of such incidents
  - Legal and technical feasibility
  - Broader implications for governance and public safety
