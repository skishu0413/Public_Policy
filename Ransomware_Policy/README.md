# 🛡️ Georgia Tech Organizational Ransomware Policy

## 📌 Overview

**Develop an Organizational Ransomware Policy**  

This project focused on developing a comprehensive ransomware policy tailored to the needs of Georgia Tech (GT). The policy aligns with NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0 and integrates with existing institutional IT and cybersecurity policies to better prepare GT’s infrastructure and staff for preventing, detecting, responding to, and recovering from ransomware threats.

## 🧑‍💻 Project Details

- **Objective:** Create a standalone and integrative ransomware policy for Georgia Tech
- **Platform Used:** Google Docs / Microsoft Word / PDF tools
- **Reference Frameworks:** NIST CSF 2.0 (Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)
- **Reference Documents:** [GT Cybersecurity Policies](https://policylibrary.gatech.edu/information-technology/cybersecurity-policies)  
- **Team Members Size:** 4 Members

## 📄 Project Deliverables

### 📘 1. Ransomware Threat Model

- Identified ransomware adversaries' techniques (e.g., phishing, privilege escalation, data encryption)
- Described common organizational vulnerabilities (e.g., legacy systems, poor backups, weak credentials)
- Analyzed attacker behaviors and motivations (e.g., data exfiltration, ransom payment, extortion)
- Provided GT-specific threat examples where relevant

---

### 🏛️ 2. Policy Design & Implementation

Aligned with the NIST CSF lifecycle:

- **Govern:** Assigned roles, responsibilities, and authority over policy enforcement
- **Identify:** Outlined risk assessments, asset categorization, and threat intelligence processes
- **Protect:** Established user training, access control, MFA, patch management, and backups
- **Detect:** Required endpoint detection systems, audit logs, and anomaly monitoring
- **Respond:** Detailed incident response procedures, communication protocols, and legal considerations
- **Recover:** Defined recovery plans, business continuity measures, and post-incident reviews

---

### 🔗 3. Policy Integration

- Cross-referenced and supplemented existing GT IT and cybersecurity policies:
  - ✅ **Password Policy** – strong authentication practices
  - ✅ **Data Privacy Policy** – data handling and encryption
  - ✅ **Incident Response Plan** – ransomware-specific extension
- Identified policy gaps and made recommendations to either amend or reference those documents
- Ensured no redundancy or conflict with existing frameworks
